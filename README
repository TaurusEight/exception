A library that provides "C++" like exception error handling to
C applications.  Based on an article and sample code that first
appeared in Dr Dobbs Journal Nov 1, 2000.

Building

No other libraries, aside from the standard C libary, are required.
To build simply type "make" at the command line.  The code is Linux
specific and has not been tested on any version of Windows.


The file 'main.c' includes a sample of how this library is used.
